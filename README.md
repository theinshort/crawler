## Web Data Crawling - MCQs Project

This project showcases web data crawling techniques to extract MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) from a website. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for fetching and parsing HTML content.

### Project Goals

* **Learn and showcase web crawling practices with Python.**
* **Extract valuable data (MCQs) for educational or personal use (with adherence to website terms).**
* **Practice responsible scraping by respecting robots.txt guidelines.**
* **Generate a clean dataset of MCQs in CSV format (at least 2 GB of data).**

### Functionality

1. **Domain Selection:** The code focuses on a website with MCQs, prioritizing one that allows scraping based on its robots.txt file.
2. **Target URL Extraction:** It retrieves a list of category URLs from the chosen website. This functionality utilizes BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract the relevant URLs based on specified HTML tags and attributes (e.g., `div` with `id="category-urls"`).
3. **Max Page Number Identification:** It determines the maximum number of pages within each category URL for comprehensive data collection. This may involve analyzing pagination elements or patterns within the HTML content.
4. **MCQ Extraction:** It iterates through each category URL and its pages, extracting question, answer choices, and category information for each MCQ. This involves identifying relevant elements like headers, paragraphs, or lists within the HTML structure.
5. **Data Storage:** The extracted MCQs are saved in a CSV file named `mcqs.csv`. The code utilizes the `csv` library to write the data in a structured format.
6. **Threading Optimization (Optional):** The code includes an option to create separate threads for fetching MCQs from different URLs, potentially improving performance. This can be implemented using the `threading` library.

**Note:** Remember to replace placeholders like `base_url` and adjust selectors (`html_tag`, `tag_id`) based on the specific website structure you're targeting.

### Ethical Considerations

* Always respect robots.txt guidelines before scraping data from a website.
* Avoid overloading the website with excessive requests. Consider implementing delays or respecting rate limits.
* Use the collected data responsibly and ethically.

### Running the Script

1. **Colab Setup:**
   * This project is designed for Google Colab. Download the required ChromeDriver version matching your Colab Chrome browser and set the system property for its path within your Python code. Refer to the Colab documentation for guidance on installing external libraries.
2. **Target Website Selection:**
   * Replace `base_url` with the URL of the website containing MCQs you want to scrape (ensure it allows scraping).
3. **Execution:**
   * Run the Python code cells in your Colab notebook.

This will initiate the scraping process, fetching MCQs from the chosen website and saving them in a CSV file.

### Disclaimer

Remember that scraping data without permission can be illegal. Always check the website's terms of service before scraping and use the data responsibly. This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates web scraping techniques. Be mindful of ethical considerations and avoid scraping excessively.
